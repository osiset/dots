# Combines a few actions and scripts to switch the desktop theme.
# Currently ignores any errors for now...
# Usage: `switch-desktop-theme`
#
# What it does in total:
# 1. Creates XFCE terminal colors
# 2. Modifies source of theme for Xresources
# 3. Reloads resources
# 4. Restarts i3
# 5. Restarts Polybar
# 6. Makes a new Dunstrc file from template (since Dunstrc doesn't support X) and restarts Dunst
# 7. Creates a PyWal-compatible file from Xresource colors
